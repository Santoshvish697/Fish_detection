# Fish Detection and Semantic Segmentation using YoloV7 and Grabcut Algorithm

YOLOv7 is a state-of-the-art technique for object detection based on the Darknet pre-trained model integrated with a simple segmentation algorithm called GrabCut. 

Using YoloV7 and Grabcut, we provide a technique in this study for fish detection and semantic segmentation. 
To find fish in the image, YoloV7 is initially used in our technique. The Grabcut procedure is then started using the observed fish bounding boxes. Grabcut segments the fish from the background after detection through semantic segmentation.
